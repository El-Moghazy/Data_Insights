Insights and tutorials in the Data Science Field<br>
This repo contains the into the data science file which is a file exploring the Kaggle Data Science Survey on Kaggle<br>
Data: https://www.kaggle.com/c/kaggle-survey-2020/overview <br>
Kaggle Notebook: https://www.kaggle.com/moghazy/into-the-data-science-career

## Motivation:
There are many paths and ways to enter the Data Science filed. Those many ways and experts opinions overwhelm students that want to start their career as Data Scientists. The best way to to understand how a field develops is to look at the trends in the field using a large dataset with different paths and check the patterns in there.

## To be able to use this notebook you need to install:
Python 3.x <br>
Matplotlib <br>
Numpy <br>
Seaborn <br>
Pandas <br>


## Results:

Although it seems that people who uses Julia earn more than people who uses other languages like Python, but with further investigation I found that 95% of the people who use Julia also use Python

Also it was noted that 33 of the 71 people who has knowledge with Julia has Master's degree and and 21 had Phd, which shows why their salary is higher in average compared to other data scientists.

There are many variables that needs to be investigated to reach a better understanding.
